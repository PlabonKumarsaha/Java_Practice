MVC - Data ,interface ,coordinator.

## System
Model : data and method to work with it
View : The interface
Controller : Coorinates interactions between View and Model

## Code brief

1. Here,the model class is CalculatorModel which has a filed calcuationValue. This
field just stores the value of two numbers and return the value(acess to the data) in getCalculationvalue method!

2. Here in the CalculatorView all the views like Lablebs,TextFields,panels are created. All of their component placements are there.
In the code there are three textFields named firstNum,secondNum and calcuated solution. So the getter method to get all these inputted number and setter
method for the output field method are created. Last there will be a addCalcuationListener that takes the button click.

3.At Last the CalculatorController connects the model and View part together.So first we have to instancate the model class and view class.
at last this snippet will connect all the codes :
  class CalculateListener implements ActionListener{
        
      
        @Override
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
           
       try{
           int firstNumber, secondNumber = 0;
           firstNumber = calculatorView.getFirstNumber();
           secondNumber = calculatorView.getSecondNumber();
           calculatorModel.addTwoNumbers(firstNumber, secondNumber);
           calculatorView.setCalcSolutionNumber(calculatorModel.getCalculationValue());
           

           
       } catch(Exception exc){
           exc.printStackTrace();
       }
        
        }

4.In the main method we must do this to show the result : 
 CalculatorView theView = new CalculatorView();
        CalculatorModel theModel = new CalculatorModel();
        CalculatorController thecontroller = new CalculatorController(theView,theModel);
        theView.setVisible(true);
