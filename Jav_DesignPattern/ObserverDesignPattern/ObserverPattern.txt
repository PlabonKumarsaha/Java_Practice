Used when you need many other objects to reieve an update when another object changes.

-Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified,
 its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically.Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.
- Ex : In stock market thousands of stocks need to send update to object representing indiviusal stock.
so you need to send updates to multiple observer/subscribers.

- This is whole thing is loosly coupled. The publisher or subscibed doesn't need to know about each other.

- Negative :may send unrealted feeds to some subscribers.

- The subjects : register,unregiser and notify observer.

-step 1 :
- Make an intrerface/class (Subject class) (ex :Subject) with the relevant methods which will take the Observer obejct as a paramerter.

- create an Observer class that will have the update method absatacted.

- Create concrete observer classes

-Use Subject and concrete observer objects.
