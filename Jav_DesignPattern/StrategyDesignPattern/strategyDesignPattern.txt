      In Strategy pattern, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time. 
      This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern.
     keep in mind about two factors :
     * 1.avoid duplicate code
     * 2.One class must not effect another class.
    So first create an Interface that will have the common functionality.
    Then,implemnet the method in the other classes.
    After that,Create a context class that will insatntiate and call the desired method.
    Create the intsance like this  Context context = new Context(new OperationAdd()); to get the desired output acordingly.
    This method helps to use the right exact method object needed instead of  using inheritance. As the behaviour isn't tied to
    subclass or superclass
    
    This method is helpful when one behaviour that is similar to other behaviours.Like in this example the system was able to do various
    mathmatical operations dynamically
